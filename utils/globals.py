INTRODUCTION = """
Hello, my name is Mimi. I'm your dedicated Notes PASUM 25/26 Bot!

I apologize as I'm a little barebones right now, because my stupid creator, Anthonny, decided to code this in the middle of the night! However, I will still try my best to support you the best I can!

To use me, please directly message me, and ensure that your questions exceed at least 10 characters with a \"?\" at the very end of your question. Here's an example:

Help - BAD!
How do I solve this question - BAD!
I'm getting really confused because of x and y, could you tell me how to solve it? - GOOD!

If you have any attachments, DO NOT SEND IT SEPARATELY WITH YOUR MESSAGE!

My creator made me so that Faith wouldn't be so overwhelmed in responding to billions of DMs asking for help. Now, please use me as an intermediary for you to ask question! This time, both Anthonny and Faith can actually answer your questions rather than only one person at once.
"""

HELP = """
Hi! This is how you use me:
1. Privately DM me any questions you have as long as it is more than 5 letters long!
2. If you need to send any images alongside your question, please add captions alongside your message so that your message can go through the admins.

That's all! Simple right? üòÅ
These are some alternative commands I can do:
/pasummatch - This was made due to the incessant request of Arman Roommate Anthonny
